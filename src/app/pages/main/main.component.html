      I am a Software Engineer with a career in Contact Center Engineering based in
      Arkansas. I&apos;ve carried many titles over my career, with skills
      including management, logistics & excellent customer service.

      Who I am
    </h2>
    <p class="leading-7 lg:w-1/2">
      I excel in fast-paced customer focused environments where service is the
      main goal. While many say they&apos;re good at multitasking, I pride
      myself in being able to handle multiple tasks efficiently <em>and</em> accurately.
      I&apos;m also very passionate about driving positive change in the
      workforce as well as the world we live in. <br />
      <br />I started working in the food industry while going to college full
      time. After 3 years, I moved full-time to transportation and logistics
      while continuing my studies. Within 6 months, and not much experience to
      my name, I moved into a management position where I exceeded even my own
      expectations. After graduating, I moved into IT as a Contact Center
      Engineer on my company&apos;s Unified Communications Engineering team. Finally,
      I recently received a promotion to Software Engineer on the same team. <br />
      <br />
      While my career is in Contact Center, I have experience with both system
      administration and cloud solutions. Hosting my own servers and services,
      both on premise and in the cloud, writing my own website from scratch, and
      many other projects I&apos;ve worked on have given me the opportunity to
      learn many valuable skills that definitely broaden my portfolio and
      horizons.
