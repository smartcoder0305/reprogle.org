My website, written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit any page within the `pages/`. `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx` are special, and shouldn't be edited unless necessary. Pages will auto-update as you edit files.

This site has [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/pages](http://localhost:3000/api/pages). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/pages.ts`. It is designed to return page data to generate a sitemap when requested by crawlers.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
